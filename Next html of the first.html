		Anyway, it's the "Next page" of my test website. I mean... it's not a website, more like a bunch of frontend files, I guess. It is what it is, and I kinda like it. Everything needs to start with something, you know. You can say it's crap and you will be probably right. But...it's my crap, and I'm proud of it.
